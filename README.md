With this quick project, I've learned how to utilize the TailwindCSS documents for styling. For example, if I wanted to add 2rem of padding to the left of an element, [according to the documents](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/padding) I would use pl-8 as a class name. 

I also found [Hero Icons](https://heroicons.com/) from the creators of Tailwind CSS. I thought that was interesting. I almost just copied the svg version of the Menu icon but noticed they had a specific embed code for JSX so I used that for my React site. 

Of course, the icon was HUGE, so I ended up resizing the width and height of it. The menu icon appears on tablet-sized screens or smaller. 

I also used the "role" attribute to help screen readers understand the links in the navbar. 


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
