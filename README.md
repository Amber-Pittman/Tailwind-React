With this quick project, I've learned how to utilize the TailwindCSS documents for styling. For example, if I wanted to add 2rem of padding to the left of an element, [according to the documents](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/padding) I would use pl-8 as a class name. 

I also found [Hero Icons](https://heroicons.com/) from the creators of Tailwind CSS. I thought that was interesting. I almost just copied the svg version of the Menu icon but noticed they had a specific embed code for JSX so I used that for my React site. 

Of course, the icon was HUGE, so I ended up resizing the width and height of it. The menu icon appears on tablet-sized screens or smaller. 

I also used the "role" attribute to help screen readers understand the links in the navbar. 

At first, I thought my only option to make it responsive was to use `md:` but then after reading a bit more, I managed to utilize `lg:` and `sm:` as well. I used these features throughout this little project and I'm feeling better about it.
